**Object of Game**
==================

The object of **game** is to be the first to either:

	- Gain *10* victory points (VPs).
	- Lead in an area for *200* years of in-game time.

**Victory Points**
==================

VPs are earned by

	- building structures
	- buying cards
	- earning accomplishments such as “Longest Road” and “Largest Army”
		-- Settlements => 1VP
		-- Cities => 2VP

Acheving *10* VPs is one of the ways to win the game.

**Leaderboard**
===============
Being the leader in any area awards you 2VP. For example:

	- "Longest Road" special → first person to build a continuous *5* roads. 
	- "Largest Army" special → first person to combine *3* battalions.

Maintaining leadership in any area for 200 in-game years is one of the ways to win the game.

**Structure**
=============

Generate the outer frame.
Before generating hexes to create the map, generate frame from pieces.
Each frame edge has a value where it can possibly connect to hexes.
Assemble frames together by matching the numbers up.

Place the hexes.
Put a random terrain hex on the inside of the frame so that its edges are touching the sea frame.
Keep putting down random terrains in a clockwise fashion until you have reached the center and all of the terrain hexes fill are inside the frame.

	- You may want to place the desert hex on an outside edge, away from any trade ports, to make the game a bit easier.
	- A variation on this way of laying out the hexes is to place all of the hexes face down. They may only be turned upwards when someone places a road or a settlement on that hex.

Place tokens.
Each token has a small letter above its number.
Place the number token with the letter "A" on one of the edge terrain hexes, put the token with the letter "B" to the right of the first placed token, and continue on putting down tokens in alphabetical order in a clockwise fashion until you have reached the center.
All of the terrain hexes should now have a token on them.
These numbers determine which roll will grant which player resources to use.

	- Do not place a number on the desert hex.
	- You may also place tokens at random without paying attention to the letters, but this will make the game more challenging.

Place the robber.
Place the robber on the desert tile.
The robber is the small gray piece that resembles a bowling pin.
The robber starts out on the desert tile, but may be moved whenever someone rolls a seven or plays a Knight card.

Place the cards.
The resource cards and development cards should be placed near the board where they are easily accessible to all players.
Keep the resource cards separated by type (sheep, lumber, bricks, rocks, and wheat) and keep the development cards separate from the resource cards.
Place the resource cards in five separate piles facing up and place the development cards in a separate pile facing down.

	- You should shuffle the development cards, but do not shuffle the resource cards!

Determine the turn order.
Every player rolls two dice to start.
The player who rolls the highest number gets to select his or her color and take the first turn.
There are four colors included with the Base Catan 3-4 player set: red, blue, white, and orange.

	- After the player with the highest dice roll has chosen his or her color, have everyone else choose and then begin the turns.
	- Turns progress in a clockwise manner.

Place the first settlements.
The first player places one of his settlements at an intersection, where three terrain hexes meet, the adjoining hexes are the resources he will earn if the number on that hex is rolled (so choose wisely!).
Next, he places one of his roads on one of the three possible places next to his first settlement.
The next player then takes her turn in the same way, but must place her settlement in a different area.

	- Roads must always be placed where two hexes meet and border the player's settlement.
	- A settlement cannot be placed on an intersection adjacent to another intersection occupied by a settlement. There must be enough space for at least two roads between each settlement.

Place the final settlements.
The last player gets to place two settlements and two roads (one for each settlement) and then going counter-clockwise, the first players place their second settlement and second road until each player has two settlements and two roads down on the board.

**Twilight Imperium Strategy**
==============================

Generally each player attempts to expand quickly into the unclaimed area around their home, and then use those resources to achieve the revealed **public goals**, which usually involve control or expenditure of resources, technology, or units (currency) in order to score VPs.
It is not generally necessary to engage in combat in order to win the game.

Initially, half of the secret objectives (*2VP*) involve control of *Desirable Region*, and controlling it grants the most *power over other players* of any region in the game. These facts and its central location usually lead to conflict surrounding *Desirable Region*.

A decisive factor in most games is the choice of the Imperial Strategy card.
Executing the card's strategy immediately scores the controlling player 2VP, and reveals the next public goal card (the only way outside of the secret objectives to score victory points). With a group of players that have previously played the game, the Imperial Strategy card generally circulates regularly around the table, with each player taking it as a first choice when possible, and a player who succeeds in taking the card out of turn is usually seen as a threat by the other players. The card effectively acts as a clock on the game, since it is almost always chosen each turn.

Many fans were unhappy with the original Imperial Strategy Card, which they saw as far too powerful, and an alternate was included in the expansion, which allows a player to qualify for multiple objectives, instead of the usual one.
